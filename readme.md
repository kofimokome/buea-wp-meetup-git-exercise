# WordPress Buea Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin for the Buea WordPress community to allow members to add their personal pages to the community website.

## Description

The WordPress Buea plugin is designed to showcase the profiles of the Buea WordPress community members. It creates a dedicated menu in the WordPress admin dashboard, where each member has their own page. The plugin is built with a custom lightweight framework called WPTools, which simplifies WordPress plugin development.

## Features

- **Admin Menu:** Creates a "WordPress Buea Meetup" menu in the admin dashboard.
- **Dynamic Member Pages:** Automatically creates a sub-menu page for each community member's profile.
- **Custom Framework:** Utilizes a set of tools (WPTools) for organized and efficient plugin development, including features like routing, view management, and environment handling.

## The WPTools Framework

This plugin is built using WPTools, a small and lightweight framework for building WordPress plugins. WPTools provides a structured way to manage plugin development with features like:

- **Routing:** A simple routing system to handle requests.
- **Views:** A simple view loader to render PHP files as templates.
- **Migrations:** A migration manager for database changes.
- **Environment Management:** A simple environment loader for managing environment variables.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin as a ZIP file.
2. In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click on the **Upload Plugin** button.
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click **Install Now**.
5. After installation, click **Activate Plugin**.

## Usage

Once the plugin is activated, you will see a new menu item called "WordPress Buea Meetup" in your WordPress admin dashboard. Clicking on it will reveal the sub-menu pages for each community member.

## Contributing

To add a new member's page, you need to:

1. Create a new PHP file in the `views` directory (e.g., `new-member.php`). The file name will be used as the tab title.
2. Add the content for the new member's page in the newly created file. The plugin will automatically detect the new file and create a new tab for it.
